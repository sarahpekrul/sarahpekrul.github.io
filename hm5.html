    <h2><em>The Origins of the Dessert</em></h2>
    <h3>Beginning in China...</h3>
<article> <p>The origins of ice cream can be traced back to at least the 4th century B.C.E. Early references include the Roman emperor Nero (37-68 C.E.), who ordered ice to be brought from the mountains and combined with fruit toppings. King Tang (618-97 C.E.) of Shang, China had a method of creating ice and milk concoctions. 
<h3>...Over to Europe...</h3>Ice cream was likely brought from China back to Europe. Over time, recipes for ices, sherbets, and milk ices evolved and were served in the fashionable Italian and French royal courts. In modern day Italy, ice cream has taken on it's own unique regional twist by being renamed and remade as gelato, a thicker version of ice cream made with natural flavors and colors.</p></article>
        <span><h2>...A</h2></span><h3>nd at last to the United States.</h3></p>
    <body><p>After the dessert was imported to the U.S., it was served by several famous Americans, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. In 1700, Governor Bladen of Maryland was recorded as having served it to his guests. In 1774, a London caterer named Philip Lenzi announced in a New York newspaper that he would be offering various confections for sale, including ice cream. Dolly Madison served it in 1812 while she was First Lady of the U.S.</p></body>
