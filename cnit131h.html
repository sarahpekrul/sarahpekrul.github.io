    <article><h3>How Subway gives back <br> to the community</h3></article>
        <p> At Subway, we are now partnering with our local food banks to donate any unused and edible food items to our local food banks. We have a year end goal of donating over 100,000 pounds of fresh delicious food back to our communities. In addition, we offer 15 percent off every Tuesday to all senior citizens providing government issued ID. It's our way of saying thank you to our neighbors! </p>
        <p> In addition, as of January 2020, we have teamed up Work America!, a non-profit 503 organization that helps low-income people receiving federal subsidies to returnm to work. To date, we have hired and trained over 1,200 people for various positions, such as management trainees, sandwich artists, and entry-level administrative positions. We teach the basic skills that people need to succeed in their future careers: extensive training, weekly supervision training, and experiencen the latest trends in in cutting edge retail and food service technology. These skills will help ourt trainees in their future roles, as they learn time management, appropriate attire, and excellent customer service skills.  </p>
